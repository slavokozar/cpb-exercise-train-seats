# CodingBootcamp Praha Exercise
## Train seats

Let's create a React web app that allows the user to reserve a seat on a train.

1. Create react application using npx.
1. Create a Seat component representing a seat. Fill the screen with several rows of seats with correct seat numbers.
1. Make some of the seats reserved, some of them free.
